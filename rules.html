                <p>
                    Cyber Clash pits Hackers against Defenders. The Hackers aim to shut down the city's IT services, while the Defenders strive to protect these systems for as long as possible.

                    <li><strong>Trace Removal : </strong>The process by which a user or software deliberately deletes traces left on a device or network, such as browsing history, temporary files, or login logs, often to avoid being tracked.</li>
                    <li><strong>Botnet : </strong>A network of infected devices controlled remotely by an attacker, often used to carry out DDoS attacks, send spam, or perform other malicious activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trojan Horse (Trojan) : </strong>A type of malware disguised as a legitimate or useful program, but designed to perform malicious actions once installed on the target system, such as stealing data or allowing unauthorized remote access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Analysis : </strong>The process of examining network traffic to identify anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or performance issues. It helps monitor security, optimize networks, and detect potential attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) : </strong>A system designed to monitor networks and systems to detect suspicious or malicious activities that may indicate an intrusion attempt. IDS alerts administrators so they can respond quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>IP Tracing : </strong>A technique that allows locating a device on a network by identifying its IP address. It helps determine the origin of a connection or online attack.</li>

                    <li><strong>Data Encryption : </strong>The process of transforming data into an unreadable format for anyone unauthorized, using an encryption algorithm. This ensures the confidentiality of information, even in the event of theft or interception.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Backup:</strong>The creation of backup copies of systems, applications, and data to protect them from loss or corruption. Regular backups allow for the restoration of information in the event of system failure or attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Blocking : </strong>The act of restricting or preventing access to a system, network, or specific resource, often as part of security management to prevent unauthorized access or respond to an active threat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Analysis : </strong>A technique that involves monitoring and analyzing the behavior of users or systems to detect anomalies that could indicate malicious or suspicious activity. Behavioral analysis can be used to detect "zero-day" attacks or unconventional intrusions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Password Reset : </strong>The process of changing a password, typically in the case of a compromise or suspicion of unauthorized access. This helps secure accounts and prevent illegal access.</li>
